We are a team of several members and from day to day we grow up.

More than +300 members are involved in the community

Tronbitcoin Foundation promotes a valuable selection of unique tokens on the Tron platform. 

Each token will be used of our collection in a ecosystem with an application for each member.


Several awards will be offered to creative and development for each member who will help TO create an ecosystem for Tronbitcoin Foundation once we are elected SR.
In order for the community to be able to continue to exist, you need to mobilize more.
Each of you must try to add some serious new members.

What is the purpose of all this?

We will form an active community, based on the development and use of the personal resources of each.

Some examples:

For Web developers:
Creation of application around our tokens, creation of bots, creation of games...

For Web designers: videos to promote the foundation, Stikers, banners...

For writers: the creation of articles, syntheses...

etc, etc, etc...

All good ideas will be encouraged.

In short, we want to allow everyone to express their creativity and talents.

We will organize a system of putting forward the best content created, as well as a reward system.

We're counting on you.

The TronBitecoin Foundation will only evolve thanks to the involvement of these members!

Open Marketplace, creators, can contact us to offer their creations on our market place.
